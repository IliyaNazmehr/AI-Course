## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze Tehran housing market data and estimate property prices based on **similar listings** using the following criteria:

- Neighborhood
- Area (±10 square meters)
- Building age (±5 years)
- Number of rooms
- Parking availability

The application provides:
- Average price
- Minimum and maximum price
- Number of similar listings
- Sample similar properties

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects property features via a graphical interface.
2. The program filters similar properties from the dataset.
3. Statistical analysis is performed on filtered data.
4. Results are displayed in a readable GUI with tables and metrics.

Similarity score is calculated using:
